# Windows XML Time Spent Editing Document

    ## What the project does?
    **************************
    This script programmatically extracts the time spent editing a word document. It does does so by parsing the chosen 
    Word document's XML file hierarchy and extracting the time spent in the document from the relevant tab.
    
    ## Why the project is useful?
    **************************
    
    This project is useful for those who want to gather data on how long they spend composing various documents.
    
    Two examples:
    1. Suppose I have  folder on CS topics that I need to get up-to-speed on and that all the documents within this folder are related to this topic.
    I am interested in seeing how long I spend in each document within the CS folder as well as how long I spend learning the material within the folder at an aggregated level (the sum of time spent in all documents within a given directory). 
    
    2. I have to write a series of essays and do research for them. I have a general sense of how many days are required to complete the assignment but do not have any more granular data. This script can be used to extract granular data aroundd time taken to research and write essays.
    
    ## Extending the program
    **********************
    This program can be combined with bash scripts that extract filepaths of all documents within particular folders to compute the 
    time taken to learn about specific topics. This in turn will help one better estimate how long it will take them to learn about different topics
    based on empirical evidence taken from commonly-used programs.
